# WebAppSample

This is a sample project that can be used as a starting point for creating a full web app. The frontend will be written in [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), the backend will be a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) app hosting an [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) webserver. Data will be stored using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). The whole thing will be deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Steps and explanations will be added to the `docs` folder as the project develops and more pieces are added.
